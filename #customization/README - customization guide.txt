*method may change later

be careful when renaming the folders, only do a small edit like a hashtag - "#" - at beginning of the foldername so it's easier to tell what's disabled or enabled

don't rename "CAT_" (category) folders

reminder for future bing soy to include screenshots for customizations

use command "hud_reloadscheme" or use the button in the main menu after renaming the customization folders you want
if that doesn't work:
➤ menu customizations require game reload
➤ hudmatchstatus customizations may require changing teams, server reconnect or game reload
